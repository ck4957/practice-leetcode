Time Complexity: describes the computational complexity of algorithms in terms of time taken to run as a function of the length of the input.

constant: O(1)
logarithmic: O(log n) - reduces the problem size by half each time
linear: O(n)

- processes each element once
- Summing linear operations: - First iterationg over array - in seperate loop, iteration over array again - another loop doing something - O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
  linearithmic: O(n log n) - combines linear and logarithmic
  quadratic: O(n^2) - nested iterations over the data
  exponential: O(2^n) - solutions that build on previous solutions
  factorial: O(n!) - all permutations of the input

Space Complexity: describes the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the length of the input.

Problem Solving Process:
Read problem twice
Think different ways to approach the problem
think e2e of the best solutions based on complexity

Patterns:
Two Pointers
Sliding Window
Breadth-First Search
Depth-First Search
Backtracking
Heap
Binary Search
