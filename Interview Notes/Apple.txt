Be ready to discuss your work experienceQ:How would you trace the source of an given issue given preproduction hardware, software and OS?  --Swap in known good components one by one until the point of failure is found.Q:How would you test [your favorite app]? Q:Firstly, I will test its usability.And then the reliability and efficiency.Second,find the bugs.:)Q:Assume an intern approaches you for help with a bunch of   garbaged code, how would you go about troubleshooting and solving the issue? --Most interns don't have coding standards yet, so a good practice of mine is to make their code readable first and then see if it takes too much work to compile.Q: How do you reverse a string?--Point at the start of the string and the end and work till you hit the middleQ:How would you create a program in SystemD that could take in an HTTP request over Port 80, and then forward and start up a web server to process the request, and then shutdown? Q: In C, write your own implementation of the atoi() function.Q: How do you test the toasterPlug the toaster into a PowerPoint. Turn the power point on. Place required number of slices of untoasted bread in the toaster - dependant on slots available. Press the Press the lever down to lower the toast into the toaster.prior to lowering the bread into the toaster select the lowest heat setting. Once the bread is lowered set a timer to measure length of time before toast cycle completes and toasted bread pops up. Retest on all other heat settings and time each of these.Q:How I would test a vending machine.  atoi c program, string reversal, command line parsing, mutex vs semaphoreGraph and Graph TraversalGiven a list of strings, provide the number of strings that are unique within the list▼This is the solution in python:l = ['a','a','b','c','a',]uniq = set()dupes = set()for i in l:  if i not in uniq:    uniq.add(i)  else:    dupes.add(i)print len(uniq) - len(dupes)lots of specific memory management questions, C++ questions  Trees, Tries, Graph Traversals etc. Given a vector of integers, return true if each integer has a duplicate within the vector and false if not.  some basic string searching or reversing linked list.finding maximum sum in a row in the interger array (contains minus) -To find max sum, find two max numbers in the list and their sum is max sum, O(n) operation0▼int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {        int n = nums.length;        int[] dp = new int[n];//dp[i] means the maximum subarray ending with A[i];        dp[0] = nums[0];        int max = dp[0];        for(int i = 1; i 0 ? dp[i - 1] : 0);            max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);        }        return max;    }
